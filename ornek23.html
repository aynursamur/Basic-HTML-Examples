<p>Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.</p>
<h2>Block-level Elements</h2>
<p>A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>
